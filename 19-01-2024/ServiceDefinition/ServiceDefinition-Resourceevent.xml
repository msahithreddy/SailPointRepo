  <Description>
Service definition for the ResourceEvent processor.  The attributes
map contains the refresh options passed to the Identitizer.  You can set
"noRefresh" to "true" to disable refresh.  This can run independent
of SMListener and does not need to be on the same host.  But if you're
running SMListener, you need to be running this somewhere as well.
